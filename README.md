Gonna do something, yeah!

# TODO:

* Connect to IRC. Follow the guide! https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/IRC.md

* Make settings.txt where we can put all bot info except api key.

* Put api key ( http://www.twitchapps.com/tmi/ ) in hidden file, make sure 
to not commit it. Maybe use environment variable instead.
