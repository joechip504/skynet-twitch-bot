Gonna do something, yeah!

# SETUP
Steps to start up skynet:

1. Fill out **two setup files** (default names are settings.txt and .apikey.txt)

* **settings.txt** is included. To connect as another user, change the provided
information. 

* **.apikey.txt** is NOT included. The contents of this file should consist
**only** of your api key.

* If you used different file names, change SETTINGS_FILE and API_KEY_FILE 
at the top of 'connect.py' accordingly.



# TODO:

* Connect to IRC. Follow the guide! https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/blob/master/IRC.md

* Make settings.txt where we can put all bot info except api key.

* Put api key in hidden file, make sure 
to not commit it. Maybe use environment variable instead.
